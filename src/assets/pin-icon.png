I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create image files or any other binary files. However, I can guide you through the process of creating a pin icon using a graphic design software or provide you with a description of how it might look.

If you want to create a pin icon yourself, you can follow these general steps using a software like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or any other vector graphic design tool:

1. Open your graphic design software and create a new document.
2. Use the shape tool to create a circle for the top part of the pin.
3. Create a rectangle for the body of the pin, and align it with the bottom of the circle.
4. Use the pen tool or a similar tool to create the sharp end of the pin. This is typically a triangle shape that is aligned with the bottom of the rectangle.
5. Combine the circle, rectangle, and triangle to create the complete pin shape.
6. Apply a fill color to the pin. Red is a common choice for location markers because it stands out, but you can choose any color that you prefer.
7. Optionally, add a white stroke or outline to the pin to enhance its visibility against different backgrounds.
8. Save your design as a PNG file with a transparent background for use on maps or any other application.

Remember, this is a general guide, and the actual steps may vary depending on the software you're using. If you need a more detailed tutorial for a specific software, please let me know, and I can provide instructions tailored to that program.
